Like many Unix hackers who move around from machine to machine I often
found I spent a lot of time messing around setting up my environment.
Eventually I moved all my dotfiles into version control and scripted
up some quick set-up instructions.

shouldn't do it unless you are confident it won't hose your system. I
offer no such guarantees ;-)
